You can now move symbol from your project to any library and re-attach all the symbol instances to this library. also it keep the overrides without any problems and it work with abstract that have libraries not in your local machine


<h1> How it works </h1>
<p>
there is 2 ways:
Select one or multiple symbols or symbol instance and select from the plugin menu Move selected artboards to library.
a pop up will appear to select the libraries you have
choose your librery and click select
Volaaaa you have the symbols re-attached

the second way is to select from the plugin menu Move all document symbols then select the target library and you will have everything connected

Important: if you have too many symbols the plugin will take some time so please wait until it finish
